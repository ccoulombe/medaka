Medaka
======

`medaka` is a tool to create a consensus sequence of nanopore sequencing data.
This task is performed using neural networks applied a pileup of individual
sequencing reads against a draft assembly. It outperforms graph-based methods
operating on basecalled data, and can be competitive with state-of-the-art
signal-based methods whilst being much faster.

As input `medaka` accepts reads in either a `.fasta` or a `.fastq` file. It
requires a draft assembly as a `.fasta`.

Features
--------

  * Requires only basecalled data.
  * Improved accurary over graph-based methods (e.g. Racon).
  * 50X faster than Nanopolish.
  * Includes extras for implementing and training bespoke correction
    networks.
  * Works on Linux (MacOS and Windows support is untested).
  * Open source (Mozilla Public License 2.0).


Tools to enable the creation of draft assembies can be found in a sister
project `pomoxis <https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis>`_.
