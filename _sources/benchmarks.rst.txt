Benchmarks
==========

The following demonstrates the utility of Medaka's neural network in forming an
improved consensus from a pileup of reads.

Results were obtained using the default model provided with `medaka`. This model
was trained using data obtained from E.coli, S.cerevisaie and H.sapiens samples.
Training data were basecalled using Guppy 0.3.0. Draft assemblies were created
using the `mini_assemble
<https://nanoporetech.github.io/pomoxis/examples.html#fast-de-novo-assembly>`_
pipeline in `pomoxis <https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis>`_. 

Error statistics were calculated using the `pomoxis
<https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis>`_ program `stats_from_bam` after
aligning 100kb chunks of the consensus to the reference. Reported metrics are
median values over all chunks. 


Comparison of `medaka` and `nanopolish` 
---------------------------------------

Evaluation of the model was performed using the `medaka` E.coli
:doc:`walkthrough` dataset. These data we not used to train the model.
Basecalling was performed with `scrappie v1.3.2
<https://github.com/nanoporetech/scrappie>`_ using the `rgrgr_r94` model. The
pileup had a median depth of ~80-fold. `nanopolish v0.10.1
<https://github.com/jts/nanopolish>`_ was run with homopolymer correction but
without methylation correction. `medaka` and `nanopolish` were run on the same
hardware.  

+-----------------+--------+------------+
|                 | medaka | nanopolish |
+=================+========+============+
| Q(Accuracy)     |  31.55 |  31.22     |

| Q(Identity)     |  46.02 |  45.23     |

| Q(Deletion)     |  32.60 |  31.81     |
+-----------------+--------+------------+
| Q(Insertion)    |  39.21 |  43.01     |
+-----------------+--------+------------+
| runtime (hours) |   0.27 |  1.05      |
+-----------------+--------+------------+
| CPU cores       |   4    |  48        |
+-----------------+--------+------------+
| CPU hours       |   1.06 |  50.4      |
+-----------------+--------+------------+

For this dataset `medaka` delivers similar results to `nanopolish` in a fraction
of the time. 


Evaluation across samples and depths
------------------------------------

Evaluation of the model was performed using E.coli, H.sapiens chromosome 21, and
`K.pneumoniae <https://github.com/rrwick/Basecalling-comparison>`_.  The E.coli
and human reads were basecalled with `Guppy` version 0.3.0, while the Klebsiella
reads were basecalled with `scrappie v1.3.2
<https://github.com/nanoporetech/scrappie>`_ using the `rgrgr_r94` model. The
draft assemblies here were created at multiple depths using the `mini_assemble
<https://nanoporetech.github.io/pomoxis/examples.html#fast-de-novo-assembly>`_
pipeline in `pomoxis <https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis>`_.

.. [1] native (non-PCRed) data. Nanopolish was run with the --methylation-aware=dcm,dam
       option.

`medaka` produces similar results to Nanopolish (on PCRd data) in a fraction of
the time, and provides a marked benefit over Racon of native DNA.
